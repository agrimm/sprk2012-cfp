# Heckle: we break code!

Heckle evaluates the thoroughness of your unit tests. It does this by making modifications to your code, and seeing if those modifications cause any unit test failures. For example, it will turn ifs into unlesses, and replace strings and numbers with other strings and numbers or nil. If no failures occur, then that piece of code isn't being tested enough.

In this talk, I will discuss how Heckle has been useful to me in maintaining a one person Plain Old Ruby Object project that's been worked on for over three years, has over 15K lines of production code, over 11K lines of test code, and varying degrees of unit testing.

- Preferred presentation day: no preference
- Presentation language: English, hopefully with Japanese subtitles.

Andrew Grimm is a bioinformatician at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. He came across Ruby while using Rails at his previous job associated with the Encyclopedia of Life, but now specialises in Plain Old Ruby Objects.

He has worked on various projects outside of work. One analyzed why you always end up at "Philosophy" in Wikipedia. Another was a fork of Heckle in which zombies eat your brains unless your unit tests can kill them all. At RubyKaigi 2011 he demonstrated the Small Eigen Collider, which generates random Ruby code that can be run under different implementations of Ruby to check for inconsistencies or bugs.
